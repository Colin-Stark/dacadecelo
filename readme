This is my current big project: MentorMe ! 
Nowadays, more and more artists and creators are trying to promote themselves through social networks such as TikTok and Instagram. 
However, these creators, although talented, often lack means and visibility. 
Fortunately, we are in 2021, the era of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. 
What if mentoring became simple, accessible to all and allowed the artists and creators of this world to make themselves known while collecting donations? 
Thanks to blockchain, it would be simple to develop a single, decentralised currency to give deserving artists a real reward for their work. 
Through a website, the artists with the most tips would be promoted and could start their careers. 
Here, the advantage of blockchain is that it can process large, anonymous and universal donations for an artist. 
Without the latter being impacted by exchange rates or other limitations of the traditional banking system.
